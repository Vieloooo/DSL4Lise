# DSL4Lise

DSL4Lise is a a group of domain specified language for rental lease generation and verification. Currently, there are 2 dsl for this project:

- AliceGen: an dsl language provides a form-like interface for users to generate lease contracts and exports the lease metadata in json format.
- AliceVerify: a dsl lanuage provides a user-friendly text-based interface to generate lease verification code in java.

## AliceGen

AliceGen is a rental lease generation tool based on the Core ontology of rental leases. It consists of two parts:

- LangAliceGen: the domain specified language behind AliceGen. This Dsl targets the rental leasing domain, which provides the based syntax to create a new rental lease.
- LangAliceGen.sandbox: A interface for users to generate and export rental leases. This provides two main functions:
  - A dynamic form which let users to create new blocks and fill the blanks.
  - An text generator which can serialize rental lease instances to Json files.

## AliceVerify

AliceVerify is a DSL interface for users to generate Java code which can be used to verify the lease form generated by AliceGen. Users can use LangAliceVerify to set rules in an approximate natural language way.
